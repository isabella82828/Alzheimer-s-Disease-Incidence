# Alzheimer's-Disease-Incidence

## Project Overview 

This project consists of two complementary models aimed at enhancing Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) diagnostics:

- Cost-Effective Predictor Selection Model: Identifies a minimal set of diagnostic predictors that optimize both accuracy and cost-effectiveness, reducing the need for costly testing procedures.
  
- Alzheimer’s Detection Model: Uses these predictors in a bidirectional LSTM-based model to detect Alzheimer's Disease and assess the likelihood of AD progression.
